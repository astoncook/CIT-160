        Here at Aston Mart, we want to help those in need and give the lowest
        prices possible to the average consumer. We will try our very best to
        keep out prices low year after year. We will offer alternatives to
        expensive store items and have a brand called "Aston Plus". This will be
        a more budget friendly brand to buy for everyday items.
      </p>

        I want to give back to the community and take away the corporate seen we
        see at grocery story's today. With Aston Mart I will donate 10% of all
        sales to the homeless and food banks. I can make the world a greater
        place with just one grocery store. So who is with me?
